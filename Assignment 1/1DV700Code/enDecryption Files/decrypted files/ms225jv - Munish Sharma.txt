But I warn you, if you donYt tell me that this means war,if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by thatAntichristYI really believe he is AntichristYI will have nothingmore to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer myYfaithful slave,Y as you call yourself! But how do you doY I see Ihave frightened youYsit down and tell me all the news.YIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna P�vlovnaSch�rer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress M�rya F�dorovna.With these words she greeted Prince Vas�li Kur�gin, a man of highrank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. AnnaP�vlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, sufferingfrom la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, usedonly by the elite.All her invitations without exception, written in French, and deliveredby a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:YIf you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if theprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10YAnnetteSch�rer.YYHeavens! what a virulent attack!Y replied the prince, not in theleast disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing anembroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars onhis breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in thatrefined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, andwith the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importancewho had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna P�vlovna,kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,and complacently seated himself on the sofa.YFirst of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friendYsmind at rest,Y said he without altering his tone, beneath thepoliteness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even ironycould be discerned.YCan one be well while suffering morallyY Can one be calm in timeslike these if one has any feelingYY said Anna P�vlovna. YYou arestaying the whole evening, I hopeYYYAnd the fete at the English ambassadorYsY Today is Wednesday. Imust put in an appearance there,Y said the prince. YMy daughter iscoming for me to take me there.YYI thought todayYs fete had been canceled. I confess all thesefestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.YYIf they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would havebeen put off,Y said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by forceof habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.YDonYt tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novos�ltsevYsdispatchY You know everything.YYWhat can one say about itYY replied the prince in a cold, listlesstone. YWhat has been decidedY They have decided that Buonaparte hasburnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.YPrince Vas�li always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stalepart. Anna P�vlovna Sch�rer on the contrary, despite her forty years,overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast hadbecome her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did notfeel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint theexpectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though itdid not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed,as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect,which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, tocorrect.In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna P�vlovna burstout:YOh, donYt speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I donYt understandthings, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. Sheis betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereignrecognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the onething I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to performthe noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God willnot forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra ofrevolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person ofthis murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the justone.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely onY... England with her commercialspirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor AlexanderYsloftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted tofind, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answerdid Novos�ltsev getY None. The English have not understood and cannotunderstand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing forhimself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have theypromisedY Nothing! And what little they have promised they will notperform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, andthat all Europe is powerless before him.... And I donYt believe aword that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussianneutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the loftydestiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!Y            Munish Sharma      ms225jv@student.lnu.se      ***************************************************************************************************
