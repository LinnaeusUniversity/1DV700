Even purchasing items at a supermarket often automaticallyupdates the database that holds the inventory of grocery items.These interactions are examples of what we may call traditional databaseapplications, in which most of the information that is stored and accessed is eithertextual or numeric. In the past few years, advances in technology have led to excitingnew applications of database systems. The proliferation of social media Web sites,such as Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr, among many others, has required the creationof huge databases that store nontraditional data, such as posts, tweets,images, and video clips. New types of database systems, often referred to as big datastorage systems, or NOSQL systems, have been created to manage data for socialmedia applications. These types of systems are also used by companies such asGoogle, Amazon, and Yahoo, to manage the data required in their Web searchengines, as well as to provide cloud storage, whereby users are provided with storagecapabilities on the Web for managing all types of data including documents,programs, images, videos and emails. We will give an overview of these new typesof database systems in Chapter 24.We now mention some other applications of databases. The wide availability ofphoto and video technology on cellphones and other devices has made it possible to store images, audio clips, and video streams digitally. These types of files are becomingan important component of multimedia databases. Geographic informationsystems (GISs) can store and analyze maps, weather data, and satellite images.Data warehouses and online analytical processing (OLAP) systems are used inmany companies to extract and analyze useful business information from very largedatabases to support decision making. Real-time and active database technologyis used to control industrial and manufacturing processes. And database searchtechniques are being applied to the World Wide Web to improve the search forinformation that is needed by users browsing the Internet.To understand the fundamentals of database technology, however, we must startfrom the basics of traditional database applications. In Section 1.1 we start by defininga database, and then we explain other basic terms. In Section 1.2, we provide asimple UNIVERSITY database example to illustrate our discussion. Section 1.3describes some of the main characteristics of database systems, and Sections 1.4and 1.5 categorize the types of personnel whose jobs involve using and interactingwith database systems. Sections 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8 offer a more thorough discussionof the various capabilities provided by database systems and discuss some typicaldatabase applications. Section 1.9 summarizes the chapter.The reader who desires a quick introduction to database systems can studySections 1.1 through 1.5, then skip or browse through Sections 1.6 through 1.8 andgo on to Chapter 2.
